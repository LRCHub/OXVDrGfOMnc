```
I've never been so blind,
baby, girls don't cry
Tell me what I gotta do,
so I can make you mine
(Outside)
But baby,
I know that
you ain't wrong (Oh, my)
But baby, I know that
I know the distance is
killing you
Tell me what I gotta do
I would do it all for you,
I would do it
I'm seeing visions of
what we would do
Tell me what I gotta do
I would do it all for you,
I would do it
Save her from the light
I know you did it for love
Say that one more time
Darling, is this what you want?
So, I
You're on your knees
asking me for more
Oh, why?
But, I believe
I was on your mind
I know the distance is
killing you
Tell me what I gotta do
I would do it all for you,
I would do it
I'm seeing visions of
what we would do
Tell me what I gotta do
I would do it all for you,
I would do it
(Ooh)
Turn the lights off,
don't make a sound
Tell me where you wanna
take it now
The silence is too loud
But baby, I don't lie (Oh-woah)
(I know the distance is-)
I know the distance is
killing you
Tell me what I gotta do
I would do it all for you,
I would do it
I'm seeing visions of
what we would do
Tell me what I gotta do
I would do it all for you,
I would do it (Yeah)
